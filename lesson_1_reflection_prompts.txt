How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Visually comparing the files made it easy

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

   Save a lot of time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can control when you want to make a commit
	Its open to user error, having too many commits or having to little commits
	You can forget to commit your latest changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in GIt the file are related to each other, making a changes in one file might affect another file too

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log gives a history of all changes made in a repositary
   git diff is used to compare change ID's

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If i make a mistake knowingly or untentional i can always revert back to the version of code that worked

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control
